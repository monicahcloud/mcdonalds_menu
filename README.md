# mcdonalds_menu
Given the following datasets, containing both price and calorie information for McDonald's food items: 

McDonald's menu item prices 
McDonald's menu item calories 

Write code to merge the two datasets, calculate the price per calorie of food, and stack rank the foods from the 'best value' (most calories per dollar*) to 'worst value' (least calories per dollar*).  

*There are of course nuances in nutritional benefits, protein, etc, but we're simplifying here for the purposes of these definitions and assuming someone wants to optimize purely for cost of calories.
